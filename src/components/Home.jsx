      <p>"In the moments before the Beginning, there was no Time, no Matter, and no Dimension, only the Endless Potential for these things—for in the absence of absolutely everything, absolutely anything becomes possible. And so it was that this Endless Potential realised its own existence, thus creating the Universe and all the planes of existence that run parallel to it. As Time and Matter and Dimension swelled in the physical womb of the Realised, the Potential continued to grow alongside them within the metaphysical womb of the still Unrealised. 
      </p>
      <p>    
    Every new creation brought with it the possibility for growth and a greater complexity of Form and Process. In time, Creation realised unto itself Life, and Life in turn spawned Perception, and following Perception came Consciousness, and with Consciousness so followed Intelligence, and from Intelligence sprang Conception, and from that came the Words that bind all things into Conception. And so the Words made new Conceptions, and new Conceptions increased Intelligence, and increased Intelligence broadened Consciousness, and broadened Consciousness deepened Perception, and this deepened Perception came to know Life more fully, and Perception understood the Form and Process of all that was Realised and came to permeate the raw Potential of all the was yet Unrealised.</p>
    
    <p>Within the Endless Potential of the Unrealised, Conceptions began to take their own form, and in time the Great Paradigms awakened—Powers of the Unrealised that spoke their own Words, so glorious and so terrible. Now millennia have passed, and we speak our own Words, Words that marry the tongues of the Mundane with tongues of those whose mystical insight teaches us of the Gods and the world, of the Mortal and Immortal, and with them we may sculpt the world to our Will and the universe to our Design. So it is, and so shall it be."</p>
