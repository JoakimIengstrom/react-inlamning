# React inlämning - Joakim Engström

My app is just a simple SPA for some input from my hobby.<br/>
Easy nav with dom-routing.

The Gallery is just a simple import of pitchures that i styled with some flexboxes.<br/>
I did add a vote-handler that uses useState to save down the addtion of each vote.

Last a little guestbook with a Form to add your message. For now it just overwrite the old one each time.<br/>
Here I use both useState and userEffect to make it work as I want. If I would work more on it I would ofcourse add a new message each time instead of overwriting it.
